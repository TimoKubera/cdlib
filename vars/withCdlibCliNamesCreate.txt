These names are exported as environment variables. 
These environment variables are prefixed with <code>CDLIB_</code></p><h4>Example</h4><p>Prerequisite is to have configured the <a href="../cli/README.md#container-agent-setup">Kubernetes agent</a> accordingly.</p><pre><code class="language-groovy">withCdlibCliNamesCreate(containerName: 'cdlib-cli') {
