# Contrib folder

> **NOTE**: Since we are not using these files regularly they might be out of date or require modification. Please bear in mind that we are not the authors and therefore can only give limited support if at all.

## What is this?
This folder contains files and snippets that have been shared with us to help other teams,
but are not applicable to our showcases.

## How can I contribute?
If you would like to contribute, please create a fork and open a PR.
The PR should contain your files, a quick description on what they are,
and ideally a README or other form of short documentation explaining on how to use them.

Compare [this folder](/contrib/dast/keycloakOAuthJsScripts) if you need an example.
