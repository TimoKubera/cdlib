## Status

Accepted

## Context

- Our existing project [SDC](https://git.dhl.com/CDLib/SDC) have been implemented with Kotlin and Micronaut.
- We like those technologies and have made good experiences with it. Therefore, we want to continue using it.
- We have the option to compile the cli statically ahead of time with [Graalvm Native Image](https://www.graalvm.org/docs/getting-started/#native-images)  

## Decision

We will also implement the JIRA Collector using Kotlin and Micronaut.

## Consequences

None
