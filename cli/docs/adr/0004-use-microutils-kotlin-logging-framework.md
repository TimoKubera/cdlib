# 4. Use MicroUtils Kotlin Logging Framework

Date: 2021-08-18

## Status

Accepted

## Context

- Using the normal Java logging API is not Kotlin idiomatic
- We have to do a lot of logging and want an easy solution.

## Decision

We use [MicroUtils Logging Framework](https://github.com/MicroUtils/kotlin-logging) as it is Kotlin idiomatic wrapper around the Java logging API 

## Consequences
